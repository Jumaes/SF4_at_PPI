# SF4_at_PPI
Program to extract relative coordinates of Cys holding 4Fe4S clusters in protein structures and using that data to find AA positions in other proteins, where potentially an SF4 could fit at a protein-protein interface. Written as part of my research as a postdoc in the Tezcan lab at UCSD around spring of 2018.
